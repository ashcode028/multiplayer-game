# BASIC PONG game
	single player mode- where player competes with the computer
	multiplayer mode-2 players compete with each other
	this was made in 2 weeks as a part of a course called PIS (IIITD)
	The movement of your palm relative to ULTRASONIC SENSORS controls the paddle on the screen.

### how it is working-
* The relative distance between the palm and sensor is sent to arduino(ultrasonic sensor).
* The arduino filters out the garbage distance(upto 95% accuracy),sends the filtered input to processing.
* Processing is built on java platform which uses similar syntax, provides user interface for the game.  
## softwares used-
	1.arduino 
	2.processing 3
## sensor-
